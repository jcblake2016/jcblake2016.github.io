	 <P> The TW Foundation was established in 1996 with the idea of bringing golf into the
	  inner-city. It was founded by Tiger and his father Earl. The foundation runs golf 
	  clinics all over the country and employs over 100 people. It always has a scholar 
	  program that helps improve the health, education and welfare of children in the 
	  United States. </P>
