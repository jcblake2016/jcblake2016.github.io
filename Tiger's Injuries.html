		<title> Tiger's Injuries </title>

	<body>
	<P> Throughout his career Tiger has been a very injury prone golfer. Some people may think it is bad luck but I believe
		it is due to his tremendous work ethic that his body just cannot keep up with. Tiger revolutionized the way golf was played.
		He worked out four times a day, running, lifting weights and especially hitting golf balls. He worked out like no golfer before him
		in order to gain the advantage of hitting so far off the tee that in some cases he was 50 yards ahead of his competitors. 
	</P>
	
	
	<P> Recently Tiger has had many injuries with his back and multiple surgeries. He also has gotten older. Due to his injuries and his age
		I do not think we will ever see the same Tiger again.
