	<P> Nike recently disbanded their golf equipment division, forcing Tiger to change to Taylormade </P>
	
	<P> In 1996 when Tiger first turned pro, Nike wanted to make sure that Tiger was going to be their sponsor because they knew he was going to change the game. 
	Nike trying to sway Tiger offered the 20 year old a blockbuster 5-year, $40 million contract that led everyone to ask the question "Is a golfer really worth that much?". 
	The answer is yes. </P>
